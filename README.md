The work
========

Fresh is written in [SASS 3.3.0](http://sass-lang.com) (SCSS superset syntax). This means that in order to compile it into CSS, you must have SASS 3.3.0 installed on your computer. Installation instructions can be found [here](http://sass-lang.com/install).

Compiling Fresh
===============

Fresh is compiled with the following command:

	sass --scss --style extended --precision 5 --E UTF-8 fresh.scss:fresh.css

Note that the output is in the same directory as the source file fresh.scss. If you don't feel comfortable about compiling Fresh on, say, your desktop, you can move it to a desired directory and the output will end up there.
